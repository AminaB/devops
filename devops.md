    Shorter deployment cycles

### Back in time :
    Waterfall : Long planning phases
    Agility : Small, frequent cycles. We focus on doing work in samll pieces & releasing features very frequently
    Devops and agile often go hand and hand 
    It can be difficult to do agile without Devops & it can be difficult to do devops without agile 
#### Traditional Silos
    Dev, QA and Ops work in silos.

### Devops Goals and culture
    for the dev team the KPi = speed, and for ops team the KPI = stability
    in devops dev and ops are one team, they work together
    Goals:
        - Delivery features quickly
        - Maintain stability (less fealures and immediately recovery them)
        - Goeal is spead
        - Shared Goals
        - Time to market
#### In devops : when dev commit a code, there is :
    Automated builds
    Automated integration
    Automated testing
    Automated deployement
    Parallel Processing
    Highly Efficent Teams
    Robust Automation process (bug always fixed before users notice them)

### Devops Concepts & practices
#### Build automation
    Build automation is independent of an IDE
    So build code is not dependent on specific individuals, it has to be portable
    for that we use Continuous integration (CI).
- CI : Reduce Merge conflicts, frequently merging the code changes, automatic notifications to the code owners, etc...
- Ci tools : Jenkins, TeamCity, CircleCi, Gitlab CI, etc...
